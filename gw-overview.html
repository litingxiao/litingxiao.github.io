                                    <h4> Down the history lane...</h4>
                                    In 1609, Galileo Galilei pointed his telescope up to the night sky and made spectacular discoveries that revolutionized modern astronmy. <b>That is the beginning of modern electromagnetic wave (EM) astronomy.</b> At last, humankind was no longer "blind" to the cosmos.
                                    <br/><br/>
                                    
                                    406 years later, on September 14, 2015, the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) detectors made the first direct detection of gravitational waves, GW150914, coming from the collision of two <em>black holes</em>. <b>This event marked the beginning of gravitational-wave (GW) astronomy.</b> At last, humankind was no longer "deaf" to the cosmos.
                                    <br/><br/>
                                    
                                    Merely 2 years later, on August 17, 2017, LIGO and Virgo made the first detection of GWs from two colliding <em>neutrons stars</em>, GW170817. Subsequently, this same event was observed in EM waves across the whole spectrum in the following seconds to tens of days by EM telescopes around the globe. <b>A new era of astronomy - multimessenger astronomy - began on that day when joint GW-EM observations were made from the same cosmic event for the first time in human history.</b>

                                    <h4> What are gravitational waves?</h4>
                                    <b>In one sentence, gravitational waves are ripples in spacetime curvature created by accelerating masses, predicted back in 1916 by Einstein's General Theory of Relativity (GR).</b> Let's elaborate on this. Static gravitational fields, or resting masses, are described as a curvature in spacetime in GR. This is "gravity". Changing gravitational fields, or accelerating masses, generate <em>ripples</em> of spacetime curvature. This is "gravitational waves". As such, GWs are messengers of changing gravitational fields.
                                    <br/><br/>
                                    
                                    As GWs pass by objects, the observer on earth would detect that the distances between objects increase and decrease periodically, known as the effects of strain. GWs are extremely weak, with typical strain on the order of ~10<sup>-21</sup>, corresponding to ~10<sup>-18</sup>m length change in LIGO detectors' 4km interferometer arms. This is ~1000 times smaller than the proton radius of ~1fm, or ~10<sup>-15</sup>m.
                                    <br/><br/>
                                    
                                    Let's compare EM waves from Maxwell's equations with GWs from Einstein's equations:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>GWs travel at the speed of GWs (duh!), which is the maximum speed allowed by GR, the speed of light. Thus, gravitons have zero mass. EM waves travel at the speed of light. Photons also have zero mass.</li>
                                        <li>GWs are transverse to the direction of propagation and have two <em>tensor</em> polarization states, "cross" and "plus". Thus, gravitons are spin-2 particles. EM waves are also transverse to the direction of propagation and have two <em>vector</em> polarizarion states, "x" and "y". Thus, photons are spin-1 particles.</li>
                                        <li>GWs have standard wave properties, such as overtones and higher order modes. So do EM waves.</li>
                                    </ul><br/>
                                                                        
                                    The Nobel Prize in Physics in 1993 was awarded to Russell A. Hulse and Joseph H. Taylor, Jr. for their discovery of the Hulse-Taylor binary pulsar, which also provided the first indirect evidence of GWs. And the 2017 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to Rainer Weiss, Kip S. Thorne and Barry C. Barish <em>“for decisive contributions to the LIGO detector and the observation of gravitational waves”</em>.

                                    With direct observations of GWs by LIGO using prescribed gravitational waveforms computed using numerical relativity, once again, we proved that "Einstein was right". <b>At least, for the moment being.</b>

									<p>
                                    For ground based detectors like Advanced LIGO, there are 4 main astrophysical sources that could produce GWs. These are <b>coalescing compact binaries, rapidly spinning neutron stars, asymmetric core collapse supernovae, and the cosmic gravitational wave background from the Big Bang.</b>

                                                <h4>Compact Binary Coalescence (CBC)</h4>
                                                <p>
                                                This type includes stellar systems of binary black holes (BBHs), binary neutron stars (BNSes), and neutron star - black holes (NSBHs). For LIGO, these systems produce effectively transient signals when the two bodies in a system plunge into each other and produce GW signals that fall into LIGO's sensitive frequency range. For BBHs, signals last for usually a fraction of its last second before merger. For BNSes, signals last for tens to hundreds of seconds leading up to merger. These are chirp-like wave signals in LIGO, which increases in frequency and amplitude as they draw closer to merger.
                                                <br/><br/>
                                                CBCs have been the only detected astrophysical sources up till LIGO Observing Run 2. Stellar black holes are not observable in EM waves. GWs, instead, are great messengers for their existence and a great tool to study their properties and dynamics. On the other hand, neutron stars are still very much an enigma. Just like how the first LIGO BNS signal, GW170817, enabled us to learn so much about neutron stars, GWs will continue guiding us to solve the mysteries of neutron stars.

                                                Pulsars, or spinning neutron stars, are so very dense. (In fact, their high densities are one reason we don't know much about them, as we cannot reproduce such dense environments in labs on Earth.) Added with the fact that they are rapidly spinning, pulsars are mostly spherically symmetric. Therefore, pulsars don't generally emit GWs. But in the case where there exist tiny deformations on a pulsar (a few centimeters of a bump is all it takes!), it will no longer be spinning spherically symmetric. Pulsars will thus emit GWs that we describe as continuous waves. Continuous waves are of fairly constant amplitudes and frequencies and are comparably weaker than other types.

Such GWs are not well modeled, as supernovae are not well understood. Asymmetric core collapse supernovae could leave burst-like signals in the LIGO frequency band.

                                                <p>
                                                Many cosmology models suggest that the Universe went through an inflation epoch not long after the Big Bang. Inflation is a period of exponential expansion of the early Universe. If such expansion was not symmetric homogeneously, a Cosmic GW Background (CGWB) was likely created. Just like detecting the EM relic radiation from the early Universe, the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), detecting a CGWB can help us learn about the origin and early history of the Universe. GWs cannot be absorbed, scattered, or shielded. The CGWB could potentially take us back to ~10<sup>36</sup>s after the Big Bang, compared to 380,000 years after the Big Bang as learned from the CMB. Just like the CMB, the CGWB is expected to be homogeneous and isotropic, which are stochastic GWs.
