                                    <p style="text-align: left;">
                                    I work on the development and operation of one of LIGO's main discovery pipelines - the PyCBC search pipeline for gravitational waves (GWs) from compact binary coalescences (CBCs). The goal of PyCBC is to <b>identify candidate GW signals in LIGO data</b> and to <b>provide statistical significance of GW candidates</b>.
                                    <br/><br/>
                                    
                                    Detecting GWs in a stream of noisy data is a challenging task, since the amplitude of GW signals is comparable to the noise background, if not lower. We thus need to implement various <b>signal processing</b> techniques. At its core, PyCBC performs a <b>matched-filtering</b> search for GWs from CBCs using a bank of gravitaional-waveform templates distributed in a chosen parameter space.
                                    <br/><br/>
                                    
                                    With GWs from CBCs being well-modeled, matched filtering is the optimal search method. If detector data are stationary and Gaussian, the matched-filter signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) would suffice as a detection statistic. However, detector data are in no way stationary or Gaussian. Advanced techniques are required to eliminate or mitigate noise transients. Additional to SNR, we implement two more chi-squared statistics to battle loud noise transients, which essentially compute the signal power in some space and evaluate its likelihood of being a GW signal. SNR is then re-weighted by these chi-squared statistics. For each detector, we only keep triggers with re-weighted SNRs above a certain threshold, which constitute our single detector triggers.
                                    <br/>
                                    
                                    <center><a class="image fit" style='width: 70%'><img src="images/mf.png" alt="" /></a></center>
                                    <center><figcaption style='width: 70%'>Matched filtering in action. We match a waveform template with the stream of data at every timestamp. If the two match well, we obtain a high SNR at the corresponding timestamp, and vice versa. This process is performed on all gravitational waveform templates in the pre-generated template bank.</figcaption></center>
                                    
                                    <br/>
                                    To claim confident detections, a coincidence test is performed once single detector triggers are ready. We combine re-weighted SNRs from all detectors to obtain a network SNR. This network SNR is further re-weighted using a probability distribution map of signal vs. noise over time delay, phase and amplitude, calculated aforehand. This final statistic is what we use as the detection statistic. Coincident triggers with detection statistics above a certain treshold are our final GW candidates.
                                    <br/><br/>
                                    
                                    To obtain statistical significance, false-alarm rates, of GW candidates, we apply a huge amount of time-shifts larger than the time-coincidence window to the data to generate background data that are physically impossible to contain real GWs. We compare the original data to the time-shifted data and obtain false-alarm rates of GW candidates. The false-alarm rate statistic asks the question: "How likely is it to obtain a false positive with a detection statistic as loud as the GW candidate in question?"
                                    <br/><br/>
                                    
                                    I am currently working on further improvements to the detection statistic by combining more information about signal coherence and noise incoherence. We are also working on extending the search to a larger parameter space which potentially contains black holes with very interesting properties. As a whole, the PyCBC team is actively researching novel ways to boost signal significance and alleviate noise as much as possible.
                                    <br/><br/>
                                    
                                    PyCBC has an online version and an offline version. During observing runs, we operate, monitor and maintain the online version to provide low-latency GW candidate alerts to the electromagnetic (EM) wave astronomy community for rapid EM follow-ups. We also operate PyCBC offline during observing runs for more in-depth searches to recover more GW events and to provide more precise science statements about them.

                                    Bayesian inference is essential in studying GW science. Once GW detections have been made, we apply Bayesian inference to extract source parameters (<b>parameter estimation</b>). And this, in turn, enables us to study the astrophysical properties of individual sources of GWs. We also use Bayesian inference to decide between models (<b>model selection</b>), such as selecting between a model with precessing spins and one with aligned spins for a compact binary. In addition, Bayesian inference is a tool to extract hyper-parameters of population properties (<b>hierarchical Bayesian inference</b>).

                                    Bilby is a Bayesian inference package designed for GW science that also goes beyond it. I am a developer of the Bilby module and have utilized Bilby to analyze LIGO's GWTC-1 events. My current effort involving Bilby is to study higher-order modes of GWs through Bilby analysis of various events.

                                    We pursue a fast gravitational waveform modeling method, compared to the traditional forward modeling. We first represent GW waveforms as weighted sums over <b>reduced bases</b>. This presents a huge computational gain over numerical relativity computed waveforms while retaining sufficiently high waveform accuracies. Waveform modeling will then be performed directly in these reduced bases. The central part is to train <b>a deep neural network</b> to map GW source parameters into the basis coefficients. This work is greatly beneficial to the backward problem, the inference problem, where bulk generation of accurate GW waveform templates is needed to perform Bayesian inference for parameter estimation. This work also facilitates prospect studies for future detectors like Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA).

                                    Current progress in this project is happening in both directions: we are projecting GW waveforms onto smoother reduced bases that include more dimensions; we are building, training, and testing a deep neural network to achieve sufficient waveform reconstruction accuracy in higher dimensions.
